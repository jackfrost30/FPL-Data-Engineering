# FPL-Data-Engineering
This project automates the process of fetching, cleaning, and analyzing Fantasy Premier League (FPL) data. It uses an ETL pipeline to extract data from the FPL API, clean and transform it, and store it in a Dockerized PostgreSQL database. Apache Airflow is used to automate and data is visualized through Power BI dashboards and reports.
